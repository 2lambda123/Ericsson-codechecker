# Cppcheck

## Store Cppcheck results to a running CodeChecker server

[Cppcheck](http://cppcheck.sourceforge.net/) is a static analysis tool for C/C++ code.

The recommended way of running the CppCheck tool is to use a [JSON Compilation
Database](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/JSONCompilationDatabase.html) file.

The following example shows how to log the compilation commands with
CodeChecker, run CppCheck and store the results found by CppCheck to the
CodeChecker database.

```sh
# collect the compilation commands with absolute path conversion
# absolute path conversion is required so the reports generated by Cppcheck can be stored
CC_LOGGER_ABS_PATH=1 CodeChecker log -o compile_command.json -b "make"

# create a directory for the reports
mkdir cppcheck_reports

# run cppcheck
# use the compile command database and generate the reports in plist format
cppcheck --project=compile_command.json --plist-output=./cppcheck_reports

# store the cppcheck reports with CodeChecker
CodeChecker store cppcheck_reports -n cppcheck
```

For more information about logging checkout the log section in the [user
guide](user_guide.md).

**Note**  
Analysis related information can not be stored since it is not collected by CppCheck:
analysis statistics, analysis duration, cppcheck command

The missing unique report identifiers are generated only during the storage process
by CodeChecker.


## Comparison of local and stored Cppcheck reports

Cppcheck does not generate a unique report identifier. Without such a unique id
local and remote report comparison can not be done right now.
