# Analyzer report identification

Unique report identifiers are required to compare analysis results.
If the analyzers (`Clang Static Analyzer`, `Clang Tidy`) do not generate
a unique report identifier, CodeChecker tries to generate one.

It is recommended to use the identifier generated by the analyzers
because they can include the semantic context of the result better into the
unique id.

## Experimental context-free hash generation method

This method is used for Clang Tidy reports.
The current hash generation algorithm in CodeChecker uses this information to
generate the unique id.
__NOTE: As the main diagnostic section the last element from the bug path is used!__

Unique id content:

  * `file_name` from the main diag section.
  * `checker name`
  * `checker message`
  * `line content` from the source file if can be read up
  * `column numbers` from the main diag section
  * `range column numbers only from the control diag sections` if
    column number in the range is not the same as the previous
    control diag section number in the bug path. If there are no control
    sections event section column numbers are used.
